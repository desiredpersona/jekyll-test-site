For many, when they think of WordPress, they think “blog.” And while WordPress is one of the world’s largest blogging platforms, WordPress is also a complete content management system and is a great way to build many different types of websites. This tutorial will show you how easy it can be to get your blog or website setup and running quickly.

## Why choose Bluehost as your web hosting service provider?
There are many hosting companies out there, but for a WordPress site, Bluehost is the first one I have ever used and should definitely be at the top of anyone’s list. Bluehost is the only hosting service [officially recommended by WordPress](https://desiredpersona.com/bluehost/){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}  and has been the number-one recommended hosting service for their platform for over 13 years (since 2005). There are many reasons why this hosting company is so highly recommended. Here are just a few of my reasons for choosing Bluehost;

- Good customer service, reliability and usability.
- Easy-to-use control panel.
- Custom-built servers to provide the most stable and reliable hosting environment.
- Get started quickly with their one-click WordPress install provided by MOJO Marketplace.
- Quality in-house technical support provided 24/7.
- Unlimited websites, email accounts, and domains – all on one account for a reasonable price.
- No contracts with a 30-day money back guarantee and the option to cancel at any time.

If you [sign up through this tutorial](https://desiredpersona.com/bluehost/){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} , you’ll see a special offer of shared hosting at $3.95/month for 36 months, as well as a FREE domain name for your first year.

To setup your hosting account with Bluehost, follow the steps below. Before you get started think of a domain name you want to use and have your credit card ready for payment. This will make the process more straight forward and save you time.

## Setting up a hosting account with Bluehost

To get started, go to the [Bluehost homepage](https://desiredpersona.com/bluehost/){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} and click “Get Started Now”.

Next, you need to choose a domain name for your site. If you already own a domain name, you can enter it here, and you will just have to go through a few extra steps to get your DNS pointed to Bluehost. If you don’t already have a domain name, you can grab one for FREE on the left of the sign up page.  Yes you read that right! It comes FREE with every new Bluehost hosting account purchase.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bluehost-domain-name.png" alt="Choose a domain name" caption="Choose a domain name" %}

Once you’ve entered a domain name, you’ll fill in your personal information.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bluehost-hosting-account.png" alt="Create a Bluehost web hosting account" caption="Create a Bluehost account" %}

Then, you’ll choose which hosting package you want. Normal, shared hosting is priced at 12, 24 and 36-month terms. To help save you money in the long run choose the 36 month term as it gives you the best introductory rate of $3.95/month. However pick whichever package suits your current requirements because at the end of the day they are great value for money.

When the need does arise to upgrade your hosting, Bluehost provide seamless upgrades to VPS or dedicated server hosting accounts from within your control panel. This is another advantage for choosing to [host your WordPress website with Bluehost](https://desiredpersona.com/bluehost/){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}.

There are a few other offers provided at sign up, which you can include at your discretion. One I would always recommend is “Site Backup Pro”, a paid service that automatically makes a daily backup copy of your website. This protects you from data loss. It really is just for peace of mind but shit happens!

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bluehost-payment.png" alt="Bluehost account payment" caption="Bluehost account payment" %}

After you’ve filled in your information and chosen your hosting package, click the ‘Submit’ button to complete your purchase. You’ll then be asked to create a password for your account.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bluehost-account-password.png" alt="Create a Bluehost account" caption="Bluehost account password" %}

You can use the Password Generator to create a strong and secure password, or create one yourself. It is required to have both capital and lowercase letters, a number, and a special character (?!#, etc.) in order to have a strong enough password to protect your account.

Now that you are all signed up and are able to log into your account, you can get started installing WordPress!

## Installing WordPress
This may seem like the most complicated step, but Bluehost has worked hard to make this one of the easiest things for you to do. Bluehost use the new MOJO Marketplace for installing WordPress and other applications. This simplifies the whole process as you do not have to manually create a database or upload files via FTP which is great for non-techie’s!

Once you’ve logged into your Bluehost account, select the “hosting” menu, then select the “cpanel” menu. Scroll down to the section titled “website” and choose the “One-Click Installs” button.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bluehost-cpanel.png" alt="Bluehost Cpanel" caption="Bluehost Cpanel" %}

This will take you to a page inside MOJO Marketplace called “Install Websites and Applications”. The “Blogs & Website Builders” category section is at the very top, so all you have to do here is click on the WordPress icon.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/mojo-marketplace.png" alt="MOJO Marketplace" caption="MOJO Marketplace" %}

This will open the installation window. Click on the green “Install” button that will start the WordPress installation process.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/wordpress-install.png" alt="WordPress install" caption="WordPress install" %}

**Step 1:** Choose where you want to install WordPress. This can be any domain on your account, or a subdomain or a folder for one of your domains.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/wordpress-install-location.png" alt="WordPress install location" caption="WordPress install location" %}

Next, click on “Check Domain,” which will make sure the domain is assigned and pointing to your account.

**Step 2:** Click “Show advanced options” box. This section allows you to setup your own username and password for your WordPress install. I’d recommend using a different username than “admin” and a very strong password. Make sure that the “Automatically create a new database for this installation” box is ticked.

**Step 3:** After you’ve read the terms and conditions (LOL) tick the box indicating that you’ve done so, then click “Install Now.”

Now you’ll see the progress page, which will show you how far along the installation is.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/wordpress-installing.png" alt="Installing WordPress" caption="Installing WordPress" %}

Once WordPress is fully installed click “View Credentials”.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/wordpress-installed.png" alt="WordPress install complete" caption="WordPress install complete" %}

This will open the “MOJO Marketplace Notification Center” which looks like this.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/mojo-marketplace-notification-center.png" alt="MOJO Marketplace Notification Center" caption="MOJO Marketplace" %}

Select “View”, It will provide you with your site URL, the admin login URL, your username and password. You will also get a copy of this information (except your password) in an email. Make sure you keep it in a safe place.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/wordpress-credentials.png" alt="WordPress url, username & password" caption="WordPress credentials" %}

Now you can login to your WordPress site. As you can see in the images below you need to add `/wp-admin` to the end of your websites URL to access your WordPress Login Page. Be sure to bookmark this page in your browser so you can easily access it in the future.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/wordpress-admin-login.png" alt="WordPress wp-admin login page" caption="WordPress login page" %}

Enter your username and password, then click “Log In.” This will take you to your WordPress dashboard. From here, you can control everything to do with your WordPress site, such as creating pages, writing posts, and changing the appearance.
