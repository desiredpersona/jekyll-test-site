After the success of my previous [post about Jekyll 3.4](https://forestry.io/blog/what-s-new-in-jekyll-3-4-0/), I was invited back to write another article on Forestry's blog about the new features available in Jekyll 3.8.

> Forestry.io is a Git-backed CMS (content management system) for websites built using static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.
